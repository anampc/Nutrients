#### Adapting *Acropora cervicornis* to laboratory conditions

* Corals were obtained from MOTE laboratory from various locations in the Florida Keys
* MOTE provided 6 tagged genotype
	- Yellow (30)
	- Orange (31)
	- Green and Orange (31)
	- Red and  Yellow (31)
	- Green (30)
	- Red and Orange (30)
* corals were added to a tank with other *A. cervicornis* kept at 26-27ºC with two pumps and build my LED light at 100% intensity
----------

## July 25, 2017

#### Epoxy

* Genotypes were epoxied together on clipboards and labelled to prevent the pumps from blowing the fragments into no man’s land

----------

## July 26, 2017

#### Tagging fragments
* Plastic numbered tags + glue + previous epoxy

#### IPAM Time 0
* First IPAM data taken by CD and AP
	- The fu*(&^% IPAM is not working  in 1/4 of the field
	- Average YII values ~ 0.6, one genotype is slightly lower than 0.6
* No pics taken
----------

## July 31, 2017

#### Dead

* Corals 185, 200, 275, 279

----------

## August 1, 2017

#### New lights

* All the A.cer, including the old fragments were fed moved to tank 1A with the new lights. 
* Same HOBO to follow temps

## August 11 and 12, 2017

#### Dead!

* Rapid tissue necrosis in many fragments

| Green             | 10 | 9  | 9  | 2  | 
| Green and Orange | 10 | 10 | 9  | 2  | 
| Orange           | 6  | 6  | 6  | 13 | 
| Red and Orange   | 9  | 9  | 9  | 3  |

# SAMPLING POINT TIME 1 (BASE LINE BEFORE EXPERIMENT STARTS)

## August 30, 2017

#### IPAM Time 1
* Data IPAM taken by CD, AP and Becca using the lab (fixed) machine
* Pictures with color and size scale 

#### Tissue samples Time 1
* Razor balde samples by PR

#### Buoyant Weight Time 1
* Data taken by CD and AP with CL scale
* YSI data taken every 10 fragments

## August 31, 2017

### Prok incubation of all samples T=1
* 100uL aliquotes + 6uL of prok / 3 hours

#### IPAM Time 1
* CD and AP

## September 2-12, 2017
### IRMA!!
* The corals were not cleaned or fed until 12th when Phil could get into RSMAS 

## September 18, 2017
* Cleaned and fed all the Acer, they look ok in general

## September 19, 2017
* Samples 136 and 145 had mortality on the base, they were cut and re-glued
* Sample 192 fall and were re-glued

## October 05, 2017
* Organic extraction and 1st EtOH from sample 101 to 236 by CD
* New 10 gallon aquaria set up


## Things to do: 

* Organic Extraction and 2nd EtOH
* Ask Stephany is there is more Yellow and Red-and-Yellow corals
* Take tissue samples: 
	- New sampling method?
* Keep an eye on pilot Acer inside aquarium
* Send report to Stephany
* Correct Ana's typos and weird English
